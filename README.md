# Basic BEP20 Token
This is a basic version of a BEP20 Token. 

You can deploy it in https://remix.ethereum.org/ 
You will need:
1. Metamask as a wallet
2. Create an account (see: https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/wallet/metamask.html)
3. BNB Tokens (buy here: https://testnet.binance.org/faucet-smart)
4. In order to check if you can send Token to someone else, you can create a second account (see here: https://vanity-eth.tk/)
